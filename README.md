# BackEndAutomationPython

## What is the purpose of this repo?

The main goal is to implement a Python automation testing framework to test a simple REST API, in order to consolidate concepts about the language, quality assurance approach and communication strategy.
The core of this project is based on [Behave](https://behave.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), a BDD framework for Python. 

## What does this repo cover?

Given the main goal is to consolidate concepts and expose a quality assurance approach to tackle the REST API testing main aspects, the content is not going deeper on each topic but trying to identefy them and stablish a baseline for the implementation of an automation testing framework in Python.
